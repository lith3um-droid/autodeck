    On real songs (Task 11 smoke) the beats are steady but the downbeats are not:
    Toto "Africa" (beat CV 0.015) came back with 36 of 132 bars only 2 beats long,
    and hip-hop half-time passages (Kendrick "HUMBLE.") report every other beat.
    Either one pushed the downbeat-gap CV to ~0.26-0.30 on all six test songs,
    so no real song ever got a reliable grid and every transition was a fade.
    Fix: (1) drop beats closer than half a beat to the previous one and round
    every other gap to whole beats, filling the missing ones, (2) cut the beats
    into segments at every gap still more than SLIP_BEATS off a whole beat (a
    slip: the beat count after it can't be trusted), (3) per segment, take every
    BEATS_PER_BAR-th beat with the phase the tracker's own downbeats vote for.
    A single global vote let one slip put every later bar on beat 2 while the
    bar spacing still looked perfect. Only tracker downbeats at/after t0 vote
    (the caller passes the steady-run start, so a junk lead-in can't vote).
    A segment with no votes continues the previous segment's count.
